# Followed by them are two files, one cpp and other py to compare data structures between Python and C++
We start with array (C++) and list (Python)

Followed by stacks, queue, linked list

We end with stack and queue as linked lists

It is to show how Python and C++ implementation differ although the logic/algorithm is same

Python does not have pointers and thus class members are used

Moreover, default referencing in Python is comparable to using pointers in C++
